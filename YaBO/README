This is a set of simple backup scripts. The provide great
power and flexibility when combined with other unix-world
tools and absttractions.

They represent slight modification of 
Mike's Handy Backup and Backup Rotation Scripts,
I've which generalized some functions and set global 
variables in a global script, as well as added an evolving
loggin and mailing component.

Credit for original work in using hardlinks for snapshotting goes here:

Other scripts, as they prove useful, will be added
to the framework.

This is intended as a personal exercise in learning
how to write and modify good clean bash scripts,
and to work in the field to automate the backups
of some small sites into multiple onsite and offsite
backup containers.

NEED:

increase reporting
present mail is dumb: this needs to collect exit values and log 
information and mail the contents of a finished file
presently, mails that the script completed after rsync finishes, 
without regard to success or failure.

verify backup routines (use md5sum for system images, 
what method for large groups of files?)
