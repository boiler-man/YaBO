This is a set of simple backup scripts. The provide great
power and flexibility when combined with other unix-world
tools and absttractions.

They represent slight modification of 
Mike's Handy Backup and Backup Rotation Scripts,
in which I've which generalize some functions and sets global 
variables in a global script.

Other scripts, as they prove useful, will be added
to the framework.

This is intended as a personal exercise in learning
how to write and modify good clean bash scripts,
and to work in the field to automate the backups
of some small sites into multiple onsite and offsite
backup containers.

NEED:

increase reporting
verify backup routines
postfix configuration to send mail
